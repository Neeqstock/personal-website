title: "Netytar"

**Netytar** is a complete software digital musical instrument (DMI). It’s dedicated to **accessibility**: it’s specially designed to be played without hands. 

Using an **eye tracker** sensor, the musician can select a note, which will then be performed using a **breath sensor** or **head movement**. It is designed for accessibility, especially for people who have no control over their hands movement and who therefore could not play a traditional musical instrument. It is a complete monophonic instrument, comparable to a flute or a saxophone.

The first version was produced and tested as part of my thesis to receive the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Pavia (Italy), in February 2018. The research work on this instrument is now proceeding as a **PhD research project** at the University of Milan, in the Laboratory of Musical Informatics (LIM).

Netytar is completely **Open Source**, but requires a **Tobii eye tracker** in order to be operated. The **breath sensor** can be easily and cheaply built using **Arduino**. I will post a tutorial soon!

Proceed to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Neeqstock/Netytar)  and follow the guide to download and play it.
