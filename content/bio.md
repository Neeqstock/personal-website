My name is **Nicola Davanzo**. I live in Pavia, Italy, and I was born in 1992.

I’m a **PhD student** in **Computer Science** at University of Milan, [Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale](https://www.lim.di.unimi.it/) (Music and Computer Science Laboratory). My current research project is “*Development and testing of accessible digital musical instruments”*. I’m focusing on making new musical instrument dedicated to people who cannot control their hands, fingers, arms, legs and feet. My supervisor is [Federico Avanzini](http://homes.di.unimi.it/avanzini/).

I've got my **Master Degree in Computer Engineering (2018) at the University of Pavia, Italy**, following a course called "Computer Science and Multimedia". My Master Thesis project is entitled "Development and testing of graphical Interfaces for gaze-controlled musical instruments": a study and the development of virtual Digital Musical Instruments (DMI) operated through an eye tracker and a switch. The main focus of the project was developing an instrument suitable for those who cannot use their hands (useful both for disabled people and for musicians who want to play more than one instrument at a time). From this thesis work, a paper was extracted and presented at ETRA COGAIN 2018 (Warsaw, June '18).

I've got my **Bachelor Degree in Ingegneria Elettronica/Informatica** (2015) at the University of Pavia, Italy. My Bachelor Thesis project is entitled "Development of a software for writing using an eyetracker".

In my life I lived in Padova (PD), Retorbido (PV) and Pavia (PV). I'm currently living in Pavia.
