I began playing the electric guitar when I was 16, and I have continued so far as self-taught. Now, I mostly play acoustic guitar.

During my life I experimented in composing music in various genres, having a preference for:

**Post-rock** (mostly inspired by Godspeed  You! Black Emperor, Efterklang, This Will Destroy You, Thee Silver Mt.  Zion, Explosions in The Sky);
**Psychedelic rock** (mostly inspired by Beatles, Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd, Tame Impala);
**Folk and Folk-Rock music** (mostly inspired by Inti-Illimani, Mike Oldfield, Neil Young);
**Jazz music** (totally inspired by Django Reinhardt and other Manouche artists);

You can hear some of my music on [my Soundcloud channel](https://soundcloud.com/nicoladavanzo).

### Projects and bands

During my "career" as a guitarist I had some bands. I'll list them here, as a "tribute" to those good memories:

- <span style="color:#FFA86A;">**Amphibika**</span> [me, Nicolas Scapin] -  Random rock music. I had the fortune of having a friend at my secondary  school who was playing the drums. We started recording some covers,  after some months of experience with our instrument. A very good way to  learn, which I would suggest to any beginner musician.
- <span style="color:#FFA86A;">**Stillbreach**</span> *[me, Michele Rosa, Daniele Salomoni, Ivan Cominato, Nicola Melchionni, Vlad Corlade]*  - Random rock-metal music. The first band with which I played "live",  in a friends party. Beautiful memories made of cellars, pizzas and  learning songs at the last moment.
- <span style="color:#FFA86A;">**Copperframe**</span>  *[me, Ambra Rosetti, Mattia Piasentin, Luca Milanesi]*  - Heavy metal, Glam (Guns & Roses, R. J. Dio, Motley Crue...). My  first "serious" experience. Other good memories. Sadly we only had 3  live experiences.
- <span style="color:#FFA86A;">**Frantic**</span>  *[me, Andrea Mugavero, Paolo Balzarini, Emanuele Dirotti]*  - Metallica tribute band. We only had one live experience. One and an  half: we had to play in a new live music venue, but the place was not in  accordance with the law and the police stopped the event.
- <span style="color:#FFA86A;">**Golden Lions**</span>  *[me, Beatrice Ferrara, Matteo Barbieri, Riccardo Orfano, Emanuele Romano]*  - Random rock (mostly Queen and Ligabue, but also Rainbow). Other good  memories. We played in a good place in Voghera (PV), and at the 18 years  party of a friend.
- <span style="color:#FFA86A;">**Lunatic Moon**</span>  *[me, Valerio Borioli, Elena Beltrami, Marco De Santis, Elisa Cacciatore, Edoardo Fava, Martina Corrada, Marcello Magnani]*  - Pink Floyd tribute band. My biggest music experience, which lasted  for more than 4 years. I had a lot of live experience with them (I'm not  sure about how many, but at least 20 appearances).
- <span style="color:#FFA86A;">**Souls 4 Sale**</span>  *[me, Paolo Bollinella, Daniele Chiesa, Alessandro Marone, Edoardo Fava]* - Foo Fighters tribute band. A group of misfits put up to attend a live event :)
